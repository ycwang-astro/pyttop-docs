# Plot making

PyTTOP can generate plots and automatically handle labels, legends, and other plot elements for data in table columns. It also supports comparing different subsets by either overplotting data or displaying them in separate subplots. While PyTTOP automates plotting for convenience during quick data explorations, users still have full control over the plots, making it also useful when creating publication-ready figures.

This section focuses on plot making, primarily using the `plots()` method provided by PyTTOP.
